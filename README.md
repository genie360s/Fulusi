## About FinDaily 📈

Findaily is a project that aims to build financial awareness on the Tanzania Finance Market with focus on Bank Forex Exchange rates , Stock Markets ( Dar es Salaam Stock Market ) and Government Mutual Funds ( UTT AMIS ). Ideally an information platform that provides live data , shows trend on the growth of foreign currencies , stocks and mutual funds to help Tanzanian citizens to invest.

## The Why 🤔💭?

According to the recent Tanzania CENSUS survey , 1% of Tanzanians invest in the stock market compared to 4% in Kenya , the rate is similar in other investment instruments including bonds , mutual funds and foreign exchanges. I believe with this platfom citizens can't get live data and monitor how different instruments perform and invest. 

## The Roadmap 🛣️
- [x] Collecting Live Data
- [x] Building the UI and UX of the platform
- [x] Implementin User Authentication
- [x] visualizing data collected in table format
- [ ] Visualize growth across time , by collecting and storing data in a database.
- [ ] Able to compare forex prices in banks and suggest the cheapest bank to do exchange.
- [ ] Predict how the investment instruments will perform though machine learning models.
- [ ] Chatbot that will use both native language swahili and english to provide updates.
